# Contributing Guidelines & Documentation

## Branch & Rules

- `master` - the main branch for the repository.
    - Do not make any commit to `./dist` folder. `dist` files are contained within `package` or `dist` branch.
- `package` - contains the lastest commits from `master` and `dist` files.
    - Auto-generated. Do not make commit or change into this branch.
- `dist` - contains the latest release `dist` files on the top level.
    - Auto-generated. Do not make commit or change into this branch.

## Commit Message Format

We follow similar format to [Angular's Commit Message Format](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#-commit-message-format).

## Release

- In order to make release, select the current draft release document generated by release-drafter, and edit the document if needed.

- Always select `package` branch target for the release tag. The `package` branch contains the latest commits and files from `master` and the latest `dist` files automatically generated, which `master` doesn't have.
